# Ludum Dare 50

### ideas

- inverted pendulum
  - player shoots projectiles from the bottom to keep it upright, or jump around/collide with it
  - enemies shoot projectiles at the top of the pendulum to knock it over, u can hit the projectiles
- cellular automata
  - enemy is a cellular automata that grows
  - can change the state of cells to try and slow them
  - zones you can't touch
  - end "zone" the enemy wants to reach
  - able to temporarily(?) freeze a region
- burning building
  - try and slow the spread of a building from burning
  - 3d?
  - items in the environment speed up the spread (oil, etc)
  - can pour water on areas to make them burn slower
  - voxel based
  - problem is optimal strat is trivial, also probably overscoped
